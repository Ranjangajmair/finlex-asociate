                    that certain business must be registered as only public company. A company carrying on the
                    business of banking, financial transactions, insurance business related transactions, stock
                    exchange business, pension fund or mutual fund, telecommunication company having paid up capital
                    of NPR 5 crore (5 million NPR) or a company carrying on such other business or transactions as

                    investments require prior approval from the Department of Industry or the Investment Board

                    </br>

                    <h5>Conversion of Companies from Private to Public</h5>
                    Initially, when the Act was drafted, it had voluntary as well as mandatory provisions for the
                    conversion of private companies to the public company. However, the mandatory provisions for
                    conversion were removed from the amendment of 2074 BS.
                    </br>
                    </br>

                    <h5>Voluntary Conversion of Private to Public</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The general meeting of the private company, by adopting a special resolution, may decide to
                            convert that company into a public company. Provided, however, that no private company shall
                            be capable of being converted into a public company unless and until it fulfills the
                            requirements to be fulfilled under this Act for being a public company.</li>
                        <li>The company shall make an application accompanied by a copy of the resolution along with
                            fees within thirty days after the date of such resolution.</li>
                        <li>On receipt of such application, the office shall mention the contents of conversion of such
                            company into a public company and give a conversion certificate as prescribed within sixty
                            days.</li>
                        <li>The provisions applicable to the public company shall be ipso facto applicable to the
                            company from the date of conversion.</li>
                        <li>All the assets and liabilities of the private company so converted shall devolve on the
                            successor company.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </br>
                    </br>

                    <h5>Conversion of Companies from Public to Private</h5>
                    Unlike conversion of private company to public company, public companies can not be converted
                    into private company voluntarily. The Act provides only mandatory grounds for the conversion of
                    public company to private.
                    </br>
                    In the following circumstance, a public company shall be converted into a private company:
                    </br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the number of shareholders of the public company becomes less than seven</li>
                        <li>If the public company fails to maintain its paid-up capital or the paid-up capital is not
                            maintained because of reduction in capital, the public company shall make necessary
                            amendments to its Memorandum and Articles and convert it into a private company within six
                            months.</li>
                        <li>The company shall make an application to OCR along with copies of amended Memorandum and
                            Articles and prescribed fees for conversion into a private company within 30 days after such
                            amendment.</li>
                        <li>The OCR shall mention in the company register the conversion of such company into a private
                            company and give a conversion certificate within sixty days.</li>
                        <li>All the assets and liabilities of the public company to be so converted shall devolve on the
                            successor company.</li>

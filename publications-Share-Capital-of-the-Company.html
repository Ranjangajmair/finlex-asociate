                    Capital means the amount with which the business is started. In the context of Nepal, share capital
                    means the shares which are subscribed by the promoters as per the Memorendum of the Association. The
                    registration fee for the incorporation of the company and the limit of liability is also determined
                    by the share capital of the company.

                    </br>
                    <h5>Types of Share Capital</h5>
                    There are mainly 3 types of share capital in the company:
                    <ol class="custom-number">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Authorized Share Capital</strong><br>
                            It is the maximum amount which can be raised from the members of the company as per the
                            Memorandum. When the authorized capital is fully issued and paid up, amendment in the
                            memorandum has to be made for raising the share capital of the company.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Issued Share Capital</strong><br>
                            Issued share capital is that amount which is called and issued to the members of the
                            company. The company may not necessarily raise all the capital at once and it may think of
                            issuing when the business grows gradually. So, the authorized capital may be issued at once
                            or it can be issued in portions to the promoters/shareholders of the company as per the
                            need. Issued share capital is always equal to or less than the authorized share capital of
                            the company.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Paid Up Capital</strong><br>
                            Paid Up Capital is that amount which is paid by the shareholders of the company to the
                            accounts of the company. The running capital of the company is generated only through the
                            paid-up capital. It is always equal to or less than the authorized capital of the company.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    </br>

                    <h6>If a company is registered with Authorized Capital of Rs. 25,00,000/-. The Authorized Capital
                        i.e.
                        the maxximum amount which can be called through this memorendum is Rs. 25,00,000/-. The
                        registration
                        fee is determined through this capital clause.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        The Issued Capital can either be Rs. 25,00,000/- or any amount below that (say Rs. 10,00,000/-).
                        This amount determines the limit of liability of members/promoters/shareholders of the company.
                        The
                        members sign in the memorendum subscribing to these amount of shares and the limit of liability
                        is
                        same.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        The Paid Up Capital is the amount which is deposited by the promoters which they have subscribed
                        for
                        in the memorendum to the accounts of the company. This amount may be Rs. 10,00,000/- if all the
                        promoters fully pay to the issued shares or anything below this amount.</h6>
                    </br>


                    <h5>Meaning of Share and its Type</h5>
                    The capital of a company is divided into a number of indivisible units of a fixed amount. These
                    units are known as ‘shares’. The main types of shares are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preference Shares</li>
                        <li>Ordinary / Equity Shares</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h5>1. Preference Shares</h5>
                    Preference shares of company are those shares which fulfills these two conditions:
                    </br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preferential dividend is assured throughout the life of the company. The preferential
                            dividend may
                            consist of a fixed amount payable to preference shareholders or fixed preferential dividend
                            percentage which shall be paid before anything is paid to the ordinary shareholders.</li>
                        <li>On the winding-up of the company, the preference shares must be paid back before anything is
                            paid
                            to the equity shareholders.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Types of Preference Share</h5>
                    <ol type="I">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Participating or Non-participating preference shares</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Participating preference shares are those shares which are entitled to a fixed
                                    preferential dividend and, in addition, carry a right to participate in the surplus
                                    profits along with ordinary shareholders after dividend at a certain rate has been
                                    paid to equity shareholders.</li>
                                <li>For example, after 20% dividend has been paid to equity shareholders, the preference
                                    shareholders may share the surplus profits equally with equity shareholders.</li>
                                <li>Similarly, in the event of winding-up, if after paying back both the preference and
                                    equity shareholders, there is still some surplus left, then the participating
                                    preference shareholders get additional share in the surplus assets of the company.
                                </li>
                                <li>These two rights must either be mentioned in the Memorandum or Articles by virtue of
                                    which these are issued.</li>
                                <li>If there is doubt whether the share is participating or non-participating preference
                                    shares, it shall be deemed that the share is non-participating preference share.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Cumulative or Non-cumulative preference shares</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Preference shares can be divided into cumulative or non-cumulative based on the
                                    payment of dividends.</li>
                                <li>A Cumulative preference share confers a right on its holder to claim dividend fixed
                                    at a sum or a percentage for the past and the current years out of future profits.
                                    The fixed dividend keeps on accumulating until it is fully paid.</li>
                                <li>For instance, a company has issued cumulative preference shares with a fixed
                                    dividend of 9%. If the company is unable to earn profit to provide the dividends for
                                    the fiscal year of 2079/080, then the dividend is cumulated for next fiscal year and
                                    ordinary shares do not get dividend until the cumulated dividend is paid off.</li>
                                <li>The non-cumulative preference share gives right to its holder to a fixed amount or a
                                    fixed percentage of dividend out of the profits of each year. However, if no profits
                                    are available in any fiscal year or no dividend is declared, the preference
                                    shareholders get nothing, nor can they claim unpaid dividend in any subsequent year.
                                </li>
                                <li>Preference shares are cumulative unless expressly stated to be non-cumulative.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Redeemable or Irredeemable Preference shares</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Redeemable preference shares are those shares which can be repurchased or redeemed
                                    by the issuing company at a fixed rate and date.</li>
                                <li>Company has the power under Section 65 of the Act to issue redeemable preference
                                    shares. The authority to issue such shares shall be mentioned clearly in the
                                    articles of the company.</li>
                                <li>The option of redemption lies with the company. Paying back the preference
                                    shareholders is called redemption of preference shares.</li>
                                <li>The preference shares to be redeemed must be fully paid up and these shares can be
                                    redeemed only out of profits of the company which would otherwise be available for
                                    dividends or out of the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares made by the company for
                                    the purposes of the redemption.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Convertible or Non-convertible Preference shares</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The holders of convertible preference shares have a right to get their preference
                                    shares converted into ordinary / equity shares within a specified period or on a
                                    specified date.</li>
                                <li>The preference shares which do not carry with them such a right are known as
                                    non-convertible preference shares.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>


                    <h5>2. Ordinary / Equity Shares</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Equity shares are those shares which are not preference shares. The shares which do not
                            enjoy any preferential right in the matter of payment of dividend or repayment of capital
                            are known as equity shares.</li>
                        <li>These are the most common and standard form of shares.</li>
                        <li>After satisfying the rights of preference shares, the equity shares shall be entitled to
                            share in the remaining amount of distributable profits of the company.</li>
                        <li>The dividend on equity shares is not fixed and may vary from year to year depending upon the
                            amount of profits available. Thus, ordinary shares have the highest risk and opportunity for
                            the highest gain as well.</li>
                        <li>Every ordinary shareholder shall have a right to vote on every resolution placed before the
                            company and the voting rights shall be in proportion to their share in the company.</li>
                        <li>Ordinary shareholders form the Board of Directors and they have control over the management
                            and running of the company, however, they are at the bottom to get paid off if the company
                            is wound up.</li>
                    </ul>



                    <h5>Comparison of Preference Shares and Equity Shares</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preference shares are entitled to a fixed rate/amount of dividend. The rate of dividend on
                            equity shares depends upon the amount of net profit available after payment of dividend to
                            preference shareholders, which is not constant each year.</li>
                        <li>Preference shares have preference to the dividends compared to the equity shares. Preference
                            shares have preference to the repayment of capital on winding-up compared to equity shares.
                        </li>
                        <li>Preference shares may be cumulative or non-cumulative, while equity shares are
                            non-cumulative only.</li>
                        <li>Redeemable preference shares are redeemed by the company on expiry of the stipulated period,
                            but equity shares cannot be redeemed.</li>
                        <li>The voting rights of preference shareholders are restricted. An equity shareholder can vote

                    </ol>

                    <h5>Other Types of Shares</h5>
                    Besides these two ordinary and preference shares, there are other forms of shares too:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Sweat Equity Shares</li>
                        <li>Sweat Equity Shares</li>
                        <li>Bonus Shares</li>
                    </ol>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Sweat Equity Shares</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Sweat equity shares are the shares issued by the company for their employees as a
                                    reward for their hard work in the company. Nepalese Companies Act has provisions
                                    regarding sweat equity shares, however it is not defined under the Section 2.</li>
                                <li>The Act does not have detailed provisions regarding the issue of sweat equity
                                    shares. However, certain sections provide grounds for the issuance of such shares.
                                </li>
                                <li>Section 9(1) of the Act mentions that the maximum number of shareholders in a
                                    private company shall be 101. However, any employee who has purchased a share of a
                                    company under a scheme of selling shares to employees or any employee who has
                                    already purchased a share under such a scheme but is no longer in service of the
                                    company shall not be counted as a shareholder, and the provision of Section 9(1)
                                    shall not be applicable. (Section 9(3))</li>
                                <li>The Memorandum of a company should mention if there is a provision for issuing
                                    shares to the promoters or other persons in consideration other than cash. (Section
                                    18(2)(a))</li>
                                <li>If the shares are sold below the par (face) value of the share, then the shares are
                                    sold at a discount. Section 64(1) restricts the company from selling shares at a
                                    discount. However, sweat equity shares may be issued at a discount. (Section
                                    64(2)(c))</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Rights Shares</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Rights shares are issued by companies when they need further capital. Companies
                                    generally do not issue the whole of their authorized capital at once.</li>
                                <li>When the directors feel the need for additional funds for expansion, or due to
                                    statutory mandates, they may issue further shares.</li>
                                <li>The power to issue further shares need not be used only when there is a need to
                                    raise additional capital; it can also be used to comply with statutory requirements.
                                    Rights shares can be purchased only by the existing shareholders of the company.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Bonus Shares</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Bonus shares refer to additional shares issued to shareholders by capitalizing the
                                    savings earned from profits or the reserve fund of a company. This also includes the
                                    increase of the paid-up value of a share by capitalizing the savings or reserve
                                    fund.</li>
                                <li>A company may, by adopting a special resolution in the general meeting, issue bonus
                                    shares to its shareholders out of the amount available for distribution as a
                                    dividend.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
